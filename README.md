I am a third year computer science student at the University of Southern California. I enjoy creating technology that makes everyday life simpler, more efficient, and amusing. Right now, I am studying abroad for a semester in **New Zealand** and will return to the United States in June.

I am currently interested in zero-knowledge proofs and functional programming.

In my free time, I like playing/watching basketball, boxing, learning history (especially the Cold War), music production, skiing, and of course, programming.
