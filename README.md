I am a junior at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science. I enjoy creating technology that makes everyday life simpler, more efficient, and amusing. 

I am currently interested in building zero-knowledge proofs, iOS apps, and functional programming.

In my free time, I like playing/watching basketball, boxing, learning history && philosophy, music production, skiing, and of course, programming.
